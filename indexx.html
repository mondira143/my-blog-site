                <p>If you know you’re wanting to make the trip into a group vacation, now is the time to decide who is coming so they can take part in the decision-making. You can always add more travel buddies as the trip takes shape, but now is the time to throw out the invitation.

                    If you’re using Troupe’s group travel planner, create your trip and send the link out to anyone you want to invite. Even if everyone doesn’t join now, you can “save a seat” for them by adding plus ones and additional travelers within the app.
                    
                    (Skip this step if you know you’re going solo.)</p>

            </section>
            <ul>
                <li>Consider both costs of flights to a destination and the cost of living once there
                </li>
                <li>It helps to narrow down destinations based on trip type. (Resort vs. hiking vs. SCUBA diving, etc.)
                </li>
                <li>If traveling alone (especially solo female travelers) make sure you choose a destination you’ll feel comfortable exploring on your own
                </li>
                <li>Using Troupe allows you to book your stay directly </li>
                <li>Once you know where you’re going and when you’ll travel</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>2.Decide the duration of your trip</h3>
                <p>If you are wondering how to plan a trip with friends or family than you should probably start from either some stunning pics that gone viral on social media, the scenic setting of a movie, or an irresistible story of a friend’s last trip abroad. Touring plans, more often than not, are triggered by external factors.</p>

                    <h4>Things to keep in mind before selecting a destination</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There’s nothing to say when a traveler’s mind wishes to visit the beaches, mountains, or a forest. However, picking the right destination according to the season is a key factor in understanding how to plan a trip successfully.
                        </li>
                        <li>Check out the best time to visit all destinations. Usually, the ideal season to visit beaches and mountains is completely different.
                        </li>
                        <li>Safety of travelers is a prime concern people specially when you are concerned of how to plan a family vacation. Pay attention to it before stating off the journey (especially when female travelers are included).
                        </li>
                        <li>Ease of accessibility or lack thereof is also a factor that can sway the decision of visiting a destination or not. Generally, the popular destinations have a lot of daily flights, trains, and good highway infrastructure to support the tourist influx.
                        </li>
                        <li>Consider the cost factor while picking a destination. Some places are more enjoyable in a luxury budget than others. Going to a luxury destination during the shoulder season (a few weeks before or after the official ‘busy season’) can result in some good discounts on hotels and flights.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Only book the cheaper non-refundable flight or train tickets if you are absolutely certain of your vacation plans. Otherwise, it is advisable to book refundable tickets if booking well-in-advance.
                        </li>
                        <li>Flight prices fluctuate a lot, keep a track on flight prices by using Google Flights Tracker.
                        </li>
                        <li>Expect a surge in prices of flights and accommodations if you are booking tickets for a vacation that falls during the peak season of that particular destination.
                        </li>
                        <li>Use credit cards that give frequent flyer miles and points on every rupee spent on booking flights and hotels to earn great rewards and cash-backs.
                        </li>

                        </h1>
                        <p>It always sounds fascinating and adventurous when touring plans are made on a sudden impulse and gut feel. However, the downside of going on such trips is that there could be many days where the scheduling can go haywire because of everything being so last-minute.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Depending on the budget and time-at-disposal, getting a rough idea of what activities should be done on what day is a vital ingredient in understanding how to plan a trip perfectly.
                            </li>
                            <li>Transfers between destinations should be kept as much as possible during the evening/night. This will provide enough time for sightseeing and activities as most of them are only possible during the day-time.
                            </li>
                            <li>Most of the times, it is better to book activities like water sports, adventure sports, boat-rides, and safari rides at the destination itself to get a better price and some scope for bargaining.
                            </li>
                            <li>In the trip planner, keep only one or two activities in a day if the purpose of the trip is to relax and take it easy during the vacation.
                            </li>
                            <li>At some places, popular tourists activities like skiing, boating, scuba diving etc are closed during offseason. Check the availability of activities before going to the destination.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
